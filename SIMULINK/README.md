# üìä Simulink Model

This folder contains the nonlinear Simulink model of the 2D Ball Balancer system **without PID control**. The model simulates the system's natural behavior under small initial displacements.

## Files Included
- `eomSimplificationTest.slx`: Nonlinear Simulink model with lumped system parameters currently set as placeholders
- `eomParameters.sldd`: Simulink Data Dictionary containing all relevant lumped parameters for easy modification

## Notes
- No controllers are included; the system evolves naturally from its initial conditions
- Once the lumped parameters are defined, each term in the equations of motion will be individually disabled to observe its effect on system behavior through the scopes of \( x(t) \) and \( \phi(t) \)
- Terms that have minimal impact will be disregarded in the final model, resulting in a simplified representation of the system




# üìä Simulink Models

This folder contains all Simulink models developed for the 2D Ball Balancer project, including both open-loop and closed-loop dynamics.

## üå± 1. `eomSimplificationTest.slx`

**Description:**  
This is the original nonlinear Simulink model of the 2D Ball Balancer system **without PID control**. It is used to observe the free response of the system under small initial conditions.

**Notes:**
- The system is modeled with all lumped system parameters included in the Euler-Lagrange equations.
- No controller is applied. The system evolves naturally from user-defined initial conditions.
- Lumped system parameters are stored in `eomParameters.sldd` for modular tuning.
- To simplify the model, each term can be disabled one-by-one to analyze its effect via the scopes of \( x(t) \) and \( \phi(t) \).

## üß© 2. `Plant.slx`

**Description:**  
This model takes the nonlinear system from `eomSimplificationTest.slx` and **prepares it as a plant block** for closed-loop simulation. The main contribution here is assigning proper **inputs and outputs** to make it compatible with a control architecture.

**What's Modified:**
- Input and output ports are added.
- The internal structure is unchanged from `eomSimplificationTest`, only reorganized.
- Output: \( x(t) \)  
- Input:

## üîÅ 3. `ClosedLoopSystem.slx`

**Description:**  
This model forms the **full closed-loop control system** of the 2D Ball Balancer. It uses the `Plant.slx` model and applies a **discrete PID controller** to stabilize the ball.

**What's Included:**
- `Plant.slx` as the process
- Discrete PID controller (matching Arduino‚Äôs 50 ms control cycle)
- Reference input \( R(s) \) as a step
- Output \( x(t) \) monitored via Scope

**Input Explanation:**  
The input signal, denoted as `xddot_error`, represents the correction in desired acceleration generated by the PID controller. This value is combined with other dynamic terms from the EOM of \( x \), summed via a `Sum` block to produce \( \ddot{x} \), which is then integrated twice to obtain the position output \( x(t) \).

**Why Discrete?**
- On the actual Arduino, control is applied in discrete steps every 50 ms (0.05s).
- Integrators and all components in the model are configured accordingly for realistic simulation.

## üìÅ Simulink Data Dictionary

- `eomParameters.sldd`  
  Contains all lumped parameter values (mass, length, friction, etc.) for ease of tuning across models.
