# 📘 Dynamic Analysis

This folder contains the dynamic modeling and analysis report for the 2D Ball Balancer project.

## 📄 What’s Inside?

- Full symbolic derivation of equations of motion using Euler-Lagrange formalism
- Inertial, gravitational, and frictional forces
- MATLAB scripts for simulation

## ❗ Progress

- Added Appendix for Parameter Identification (Appendix B)
- Ignored 2 RHS terms for the simplified EOM


## 🛠️ Coming Updates

- Add SIMULINK images and solutions for the full and simplified EOM
- Add schematics for the Kinematic Relationships and Energy Expressions
- Euler-Lagrange RHS terms need refinement
- Determine geometric parameters and calculate EOMs again by using those
- Complete Simulation Validation and Validation Envelope
- Fix documentation arrangement
