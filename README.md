These document the iterative prototyping process.

## üìä Dynamic Modeling and Analysis

All scripts are located under `Code/Dynamic Analysis Codes/`.  
Each file performs a specific analysis task. For most files, two versions exist:
- Full version (using complete nonlinear equations of motion)  
- `Simplified` version (uses reduced EOM for faster computations)

### MATLAB Scripts Overview:

- `inhull.m`, `polyfitn.m`, `polyvaln.m`:  
  External helper functions used for polynomial fitting and region testing.

- `eomGraph.m / eomGraphSimplified.m`:  
  For a given set of `x`, `xdot`, `xdotdot`, and `phidot`, computes the roots of the EOM and plots them. Useful for visually inspecting root behavior and servo limitations.

- `eomSimplification.m`:  
  Uses the Simulink model's switching logic to isolate and evaluate the impact of each EOM term on system behavior. Outputs include relative error, standard deviation, and comparison plots.

- `eomSymbolicDerivation.m`:  
  Automatically derives the symbolic left-hand side of the Euler-Lagrange-based EOM.

- `feasibilityMapping.m / feasibilityMappingSimplified.m`:  
  Given ranges of `x`, `xdot`, `xdotdot`, and `phidot`, this script:
  - Checks if roots exist for each combination  
  - Labels each point as:
    - `1` ‚Üí root exists and is within servo limits  
    - `0` ‚Üí no root  
    - `-1` ‚Üí root exists but outside servo limits  
  - Visualizes scatter plot for a selected `x`  
  - Aggregates all valid combinations across `x` values  
  - Intersects all valid sets to form a final safe region  
  - Outputs a 3D scatter plot of feasible regions and saves it as `finalMap.fig` inside `Media/feasibilityMappingGraph/`

- `contourFitting.m / contourFittingSimplified.m`:  
  Takes the final feasible region and fits a polynomial surface (`phidot = f(xdot, xdotdot)`), providing:
  - Fitted equation  
  - R¬≤ score to evaluate goodness of fit

- `parameterBalancing.m`:  
  Minimizes stiffness by tuning lumped parameters (mass, inertia) using a variance-minimizing algorithm. Outputs a new balanced parameter set to improve robustness of system dynamics.

## üß© Simulink Model
The `SIMULINK/` folder contains the nonlinear model used for simulation and controller design.

- `eomIntegratorChain.slx`: Simulink model using switch logic to enable/disable EOM terms  
- `eomParameters.sldd`: External Simulink Data Dictionary containing all system parameters
- `ClosedLoopSystemAcc.slx`: Simulink model using PID control signal as acceleration
- `ClosedLoopSystemAccVar1.slx`: Variation of the `ClosedLoopSystemAcc.slx` for optimized block diagrams and algorithms
 
- All parameter scaling and term analysis are designed for easy integration and switching

## üéØ Project Goal
This system uses IR sensor arrays to detect ball position and applies PID control to move a platform via two servos.  
The goal is to keep the ball centered by adjusting the tilt of a square platform on both X and Y axes with minimal overshoot and fast response.
